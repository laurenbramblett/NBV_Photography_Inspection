# Take Your Best Shot: Sampling-Based Next-Best-View Planning for Autonomous Photography & Inspection

This code can be cloned using the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/laurenbramblett/NBV_Photography_Inspection/
```

After cloning, a user may run either of the two samples in matlab.
- `targetCoverage_NBV_Proposed.m` is our proposed approach using novel metrics to determine the best waypoint
- `targetCoverage_withFrontiers.m` is a comparison approach that takes and stores pictures without regard for picture quality or storage capacity
